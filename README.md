# Get Random FB Bumper 🔮

Draws a name of a random commenter on a Facebook group's post. 

I didn't want to log in on some sketchy third-party app with my own FB account just to get a random comment, so I made this 😅

Tested only with Buy and Sell-type groups such as *The University Trade* and *The Katipunan Trade* with **DESKTOP** Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Works either logged-in or out.
